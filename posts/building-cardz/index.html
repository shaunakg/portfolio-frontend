                Cardz was an idea that was originally thought of in 2020, just
                after the GPT-3 release date. Given access to such a versatile
                natural language parser, I wanted to apply it to help me in my
                own schoolwork.
            </p>

            <p>
                I created an proof of concept within a couple of days, but it
                was not until 2021 that I decided to launch it as a full-fledged
                product. The full product would require more than just a
                proof-of-concept, including authentication, data handling and
                storage, design work, UI and UX, and a backend.
            </p>

            <h2>Backend systems</h2>

            <h3>Web services</h3>
            <p>
                Cardz has a severless backend that allows for scaling up or down
                based on demand extremely quickly. The main backend server is
                written in Python with the Flask framework.
            </p>

            <p>
                There are microservices that run on a schedule that manage
                sending emails. There are also serverless workers that run
                extremely quickly for small tasks such as adding cross-origin
                resource sharing headers to static files.
            </p>

            <p>
                All web properties are fronted using Cloudflare CDN, which
                allows for less load on the server and more bandwidth.
            </p>

            <h3>Database and authentication</h3>

            <p>
                Due to the complexity of managing databases as well as user
                credentials, I elected to use
                <b>Firebase</b> as a backend platform. This allowed for the
                abstraction of the database and login system and greatly
                accelerated the development time.
            </p>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    All application data is stored in Firestore, where it is
                    queried and updated.
                </li>
                <li>
                    All user authentication and management occurs in Firebase
                    Authentication. This includes sending password reset emails
                    and verifying email addresses.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Uploaded files are stored in Firebase Storage (a rebrand of
                    Google Cloud Storage).
                </li>
                <li>The front end is built and served by Firebase Hosting.</li>
            </ul>

            <p>
                While a main feature of Firebase is the client-side integration,
                I elected to move all interaction with Firebase to the back-end,
                and use a traditional REST API for communication with the
                front-end.
            </p>

            <p>
                This was because Cardz features primarily server-generated
                content instead of purely user-generated content, so it would be
                easiest for the server to handle the storage and retrieval of
                said content.
            </p>

            <h3>Machine learning pipelines</h3>

            <h4>Flashcard generation</h4>
            <p>
                GPT-3 is only available through a REST API, so it is impossible to 
                specify the conditions of model training and running.
            </p>

            <p>
                In the MVP version of Cardz, I used prompt engineering techniques to
                "train" GPT-3 on every completion request. Since then, OpenAI has
                released features to pretrain a model. I immedi
